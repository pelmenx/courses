# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
# This problem was asked by Stripe.
# Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space.
# In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array.
# The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.
# For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.
# You can modify the input array in-place.


def skiped_integer(integer_list):
    integer_list.sort()
    max = 0
    for i in integer_list:
        if i - max > 1:
            return max + 1
        if i > max:
            max = int(i)
    return max + 1


# tests
print(skiped_integer([3, 4, -1, 1]))  # 2
print(skiped_integer([1, 2, 0]))  # 3
print(skiped_integer([-1, -2]))  # 1
print(skiped_integer([3, 4, -1, 1, 1.2, 2.1]))  # 2
print(skiped_integer([]))  # 1
print(skiped_integer([2, 3]))  # 1
