# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
#
# This problem was asked by Google.
#
# The area of a circle is defined as πr^2. Estimate π to 3 decimal places using a
# Monte Carlo method.
#
# Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x^2 + y^2 = r^2.
#
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#

# We suppose a circle with radius = 1. It can fit in a square with side length = 2.
# The square corners located in dots [[-1,1],[1,1],[-1,-1],[1,-1]]
