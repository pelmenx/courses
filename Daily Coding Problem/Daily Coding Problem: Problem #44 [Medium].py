# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
#
# This problem was asked by Google.
#
# We can determine how "out of order" an array A is by counting the number of
# inversions it has. Two elements A[i] and A[j] form an inversion if A[i] > A[j]
# but i < j. That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.
#
# Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than
# O(N^2) time.
#
# You may assume each element in the array is distinct.
#
# For example, a sorted list has zero inversions. The array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] has
# three inversions: (2, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 3). The array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] has ten
# inversions: every distinct pair forms an inversion.
#
#

def find_inversion(set):
    inversions_list = []
    for i in range(0, len(set) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(set)):
            if set[i] > set[j]:
                inversions_list.append((set[i], set[j]))

    return inversions_list


print(find_inversion([2, 4, 1, 3, 5]))
print(find_inversion([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]))
print(find_inversion([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
