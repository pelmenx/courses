# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
#
# This problem was asked by Amazon.
#
# Given a string s and an integer k, break up the string into multiple lines such
# that each line has a length of k or less. You must break it up so that words
# don't break across lines. Each line has to have the maximum possible amount of
# words. If there's no way to break the text up, then return null.
#
# You can assume that there are no spaces at the ends of the string and that there
# is exactly one space between each word.
#
# For example, given the string "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and
# k = 10, you should return: ["the quick", "brown fox", "jumps over", "the lazy",
# "dog"]. No string in the list has a length of more than 10.
#
#

def break_string(string, k):
    words_list = string.split(" ")
    result_list = []
    tmp = ''
    for word in words_list:
        if len(word) <= k:
            if not tmp:
                tmp = word
            else:
                if len(tmp + " " + word) <= k:
                    tmp = tmp + " " + word
                else:
                    result_list.append(tmp)
                    tmp = word
