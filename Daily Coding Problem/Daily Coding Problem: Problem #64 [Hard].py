# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
#
# This problem was asked by Google.
#
# A knight's tour is a sequence of moves by a knight on a chessboard such that all
# squares are visited once.
#
# Given N, write a function to return the number of knight's tours on an N by N
# chessboard.

        pass
    board = [[0] * 3] * 3
    for i, row in enumerate(board):
        print(i, row)


knight_tour(3)
