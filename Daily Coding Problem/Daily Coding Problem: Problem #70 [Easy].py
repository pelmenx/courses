# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

# This problem was asked by Microsoft.
#
# A number is considered perfect if its digits sum up to exactly 10.
#
# Given a positive integer n, return the n-th perfect number.
#
# For example, given 1, you should return 19. Given 2, you should return 28.
#

    elif amount > 10:
        return None
    else:
        last_digit = 10 - amount
        return int(str(n) + str(last_digit))
