# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
#
# This problem was asked by Google.
#
# In a directed graph, each node is assigned an uppercase letter. We define a
# path's value as the number of most frequently-occurring letter along that path.
# For example, if a path in the graph goes through "ABACA", the value of the path
# is 3, since there are 3 occurrences of 'A' on the path.
#
# Given a graph with n nodes and m directed edges, return the largest value path
# of the graph. If the largest value is infinite, then return null.
#
# The graph is represented with a string and an edge list. The i-th character
# represents the uppercase letter of the i-th node. Each tuple in the edge list
# (i, j) means there is a directed edge from the i-th node to the j-th node.
# Self-edges are possible, as well as multi-edges.
#
# For example, the following input graph:
#
# ABACA
#
#
# [(0, 1),
#  (0, 2),
#  (2, 3),
#  (3, 4)]
#
#
# Would have maximum value 3 using the path of vertices [0, 2, 3, 4], (A, A, C, A)
# .
#
# The following input graph:
#
# A
#
#
# [(0, 0)]
#
#
# Should return null, since we have an infinite loop.
#
#
