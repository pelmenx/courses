# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
#
# This problem was asked by Google.
#
# You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum
# number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from
# top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is
# lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each
# row itself is ordered lexicographically.
#
# For example, given the following table:
#
# cba
# daf
# ghi
#
#
# This is not ordered because of the a in the center. We can remove the second
# column to make it ordered:
#
# ca
# df
# gi
#
#
# So your function should return 1, since we only needed to remove 1 column.
#
# As another example, given the following table:
#
# abcdef
#
#
# Your function should return 0, since the rows are already ordered (there's only
# one row).
#
# As another example, given the following table:
#
# zyx
# wvu
# tsr
#
#
# Your function should return 3, since we would need to remove all the columns to
# order it.
#
