# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
#
# This problem was asked by Google.
#
# A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes
# under it have the same value.
#
# Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.
#
# For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:
#
#    0(a)
#   /    \
#  1(b)  0(c)
#       /   \
#      1(d) 0(e)
#     /  \
#  1(f)  1(g)
#
