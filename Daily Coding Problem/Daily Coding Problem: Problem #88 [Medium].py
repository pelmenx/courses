# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
#
# This question was asked by ContextLogic.
#
# Implement division of two positive integers without using the division,
# multiplication, or modulus operators. Return the quotient as an integer,
# ignoring the remainder.

    while a >= c:

        dev += 1
    return dev


assert division(11, 2) == 5
assert division(4, 2) == 2
assert division(2, 2) == 1
