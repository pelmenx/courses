# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
#
# This problem was asked by Google.
#
# Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the
# same structure and Binary_tree_1 values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree
# consists of a Binary_tree_1 in s and all of this Binary_tree_1's descendants. The tree s could
# also be considered as a subtree of itself.
