# The function weak_md5 is a "weaker" version of MD5, using only the first 5 bytes of the MD5 hash.
# This means its hashing size is  ùëõ=40  and it can be brute forced rather easily.

# Implement a function find_collisions that loops over all the possible strings until it finds an
# arbitrary collision - that is, two different strings whose hash is the same - and returns them (as a tuple).
